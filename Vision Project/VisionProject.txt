Target : Face recognizer
Way to bypass it without being caught : 
- Ideally -> plug a small device on the camera that induces a real time perturbation on the image so the face does not get recognized BUT is imperceptible to the human eye
- Reality -> just counter locally the image recognizer


Two paths:
- Just not be detected as a face
- Be detected as another face ( nah just use deepfake bro )
